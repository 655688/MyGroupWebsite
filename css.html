<h1><div class="header2">What is css used for?</div></h1>

<div class="info">As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc. |<br>

  A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.<br>
  
  Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome, or Edge, are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector, or printer.</div>
